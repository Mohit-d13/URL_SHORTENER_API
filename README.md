# URL Shortener API

## Introduction

Welcome to the URL Shortener API, a robust and scalable solution designed to transform lengthy URLs into concise, shareable links. This project addresses the common challenge of sharing unwieldy URLs across platforms where character count matters, such as social media, messaging applications, and email communications.

Built with modern web development technologies, this API provides not only basic URL shortening capabilities but also advanced features like click analytics, user authentication, and custom URL slug creation. The combination of FastAPI's asynchronous performance with PostgreSQL's reliability creates a service that is both lightning-fast and dependable.

Whether you're looking to integrate URL shortening into your own application, analyze click-through rates for marketing campaigns, or simply make your links more manageable, this API offers a comprehensive solution that balances simplicity with powerful functionality.

The project follows industry best practices including comprehensive API documentation, database migrations for version control, and secure authentication mechanisms. It's designed to be easily deployable and maintainable, making it suitable for both personal projects and production environments.

## üìò API Endpoints Overview

### üîê User / Authentication

- `POST /signup/`: Create your profile
- `POST /login/`: Authenticate yourself
- `GET  /user/me`: View your profile

### üîó URL Operations

- `POST /sites/`: Create a short URL
- `GET /sites/all`: Get all your created URLs
- `GET /sites/info/{url_key}/`: Get analysis details of an URL
- `GET /{url_key}`: Redirect to the original URL
- `DELETE /{url_key}`: Delete a URL

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

- **Site Table**: Stores mapping between short and original URLs
- **Click Table**: Tracks click analytics for each short URL
- **User Table**: Manages user authentication and permissions

## üß† Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: Web framework
- **PostgreSQL**: Database
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM layer
- **Alembic**: Database migrations tool
- **PyJWT**: Token-based authentication
- **User-Agent Parser**: For Tracking user device/browser
- **Render**: Live deployment website
